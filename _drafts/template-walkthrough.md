## Background

Name is a "vulnerable by design" machine from [hackthebox.eu][1]. In this walkthrough I perform the actions of an attacker. The goal is twofold: first get user-level privileges on the box and get the key in /home/$USER/user.txt. Second, escalate privileges to root and get the flag at /root/root.txt.
